# Simple script to handle a DIY shutdown menu. When run you should see a bunch of options (shutdown, reboot etc.)
#
# Requirements:
# - rofi
# - systemd, but you can replace the commands for OpenRC or anything else
#
# Instructions:
# - Save this file as power.sh or anything
# - Give it exec priviledge, or chmod +x /path/to/power.sh
# - Run it
